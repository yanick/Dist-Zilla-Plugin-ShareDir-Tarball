package Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ShareDir::Tarball;
# ABSTRACT: Bundle your shared dir into a tarball

=head1 SYNOPSIS

    # in dist.ini

    [ShareDir::Tarball]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Using L<File::ShareDir> to deploy non-Perl files alongside a distribution is
great, but it has a problem.  Just like for modules, upon installation CPAN clients
don't remove any of the files that were already present in the I</lib>
directories beforehand. So if version 1.0 of the distribution was sharing

    share/foo
    share/bar

and version 1.1 changed that to 

    share/foo
    share/baz

then a user installing first version 1.0 then 1.1 will end up with 

    share/foo
    share/bar
    share/baz

which might be a problem (or not).

Fortunately, there is a sneaky
workaround in the case where you don't want the files of past distributions to
linger around. The trick is simple: bundle all the files to be shared into
a tarball called I<shared-files.tar.gz>.  As there is only that one file, any
new install is conveniently clobbering the old version. 

But archiving the content of the I<share> directory is no fun. Hence
L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ShareDir::Tarball> which, upon the file munging stage, gathers all 
files in the I<share> directory and build the I<shared-files.tar.gz> archive
with them.  If there is no such files, the process is simply skipped.

=head1 OPTIONS

=head2 dir

The source directory to be bundled into the shared tarball. Defaults to
C<share>.

=head1 SEE ALSO

L<Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ShareDir>, which is similar to this module, but without
the conversion of the shared directory into a tarball.

L<File::ShareDir::Tarball> - transparently extract the tarball behind the
scene so that the shared directory can be accessed just like it is in
L<File::ShareDir>.

L<Module::Build::CleanInstall> - A subclass of L<Module::Build> which
deinstall the files from previous installations via their I<packlist>.
