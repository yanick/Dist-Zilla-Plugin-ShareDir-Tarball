NAME
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ShareDir::Tarball - Bundle your shared dir into a
    tarball

VERSION
    version 0.6.0

SYNOPSIS
        # in dist.ini

        [ShareDir::Tarball]

DESCRIPTION
    Using File::ShareDir to deploy non-Perl files alongside a distribution
    is great, but it has a problem. Just like for modules, upon installation
    CPAN clients don't remove any of the files that were already present in
    the */lib* directories beforehand. So if version 1.0 of the distribution
    was sharing

        share/foo
        share/bar

    and version 1.1 changed that to

        share/foo
        share/baz

    then a user installing first version 1.0 then 1.1 will end up with

        share/foo
        share/bar
        share/baz

    which might be a problem (or not).

    Fortunately, there is a sneaky workaround in the case where you don't
    want the files of past distributions to linger around. The trick is
    simple: bundle all the files to be shared into a tarball called
    *shared-files.tar.gz*. As there is only that one file, any new install
    is conveniently clobbering the old version.

    But archiving the content of the *share* directory is no fun. Hence
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ShareDir::Tarball which, upon the file munging
    stage, gathers all files in the *share* directory and build the
    *shared-files.tar.gz* archive with them. If there is no such files, the
    process is simply skipped.

OPTIONS
  dir
    The source directory to be bundled into the shared tarball. Defaults to
    "share".

SEE ALSO
    Dist::Zilla::Plugin::ShareDir, which is similar to this module, but
    without the conversion of the shared directory into a tarball.

    File::ShareDir::Tarball - transparently extract the tarball behind the
    scene so that the shared directory can be accessed just like it is in
    File::ShareDir.

    Module::Build::CleanInstall - A subclass of Module::Build which
    deinstall the files from previous installations via their *packlist*.
